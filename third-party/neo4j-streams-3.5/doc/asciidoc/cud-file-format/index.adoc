==== CUD File Format

The CUD file format is JSON file that represents Graph Entities (Nodes/Relationships) and how to manage them in term
of **C**reate/**U**pdate/**D**elete operations.

You can configure the topic in the following way:

[source,ini,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::sink-cud-template.adoc[]
----

[source,ini,subs="attributes"]
----
include::sink-cud-example.adoc[]
----

We have two formats:

* One for *nodes*:

+
We provide an example of a `MERGE` operation

+
[source,json]
----
{
  "op": "merge",
  "properties": {
    "foo": "value",
    "key": 1
  },
  "ids": {"key": 1, "otherKey":  "foo"},
  "labels": ["Foo","Bar"],
  "type": "node",
  "detach": true
}
----

+
which would be transformed into the following Cypher query:

+
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [..., {
  "op": "merge",
  "properties": {
    "foo": "value",
    "key": 1
  },
  "ids": {"key": 1, "otherKey":  "foo"},
  "labels": ["Foo","Bar"],
  "type": "node",
  "detach": true
}, ...] AS event
MERGE (n:Foo:Bar {key: event.ids.key, otherkey: event.ids.otherkey})
SET n += event.properties
----

+
Lets describe the fields:

+
[#{id}_table_cud_node_fields]
.CUD file **Node format** fields description
[cols="3",opts=header]
|===

| field
| mandatory
| Description

| op
| yes
| The operation type: create/merge/update/delete

*N.B.* delete messages are for **individual nodes** itâ€™s not intended to be a generic way of doing cypher query building from JSON

| properties
| no in case the operation is `delete`, otherwise yes
| The properties attached to the node

| ids
| no in case the operation is `create`, otherwise yes
| In case the operation is merge/update/delete this field is **mandatory** and contains
the primary/unique keys of the node that will be use to do the lookup to the entity.
In case you use as key the `_id` name the cud format will refer to Neo4j's node internal for the node lookup.

*N.B.* If you'll use the `_id` reference with the op `merge` it will work as simple update, this means that if the node
with the passed internal id does not exists it will not be created.

| labels
| no
| The labels attached to the node.

*N.B.* Neo4j allows to create nodes without labels, but from a performance perspective, it's a bad idea don't provide them.

| type
| yes
| The entity type: node/relationship => node in this case

| detach
| no
| In case the operation is delete you can specify if perform a https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/delete/["detach" delete] that means delete any incident relationships when you delete a node

*N.B.* if no value is provided, the default is true

|===

* And one for *relationships*:

+
We provide an example of a `CREATE` operation

+
[source,json]
----
{
  "op": "create",
  "properties": {
    "foo": "rel-value",
    "key": 1
  },
  "rel_type": "MY_REL",
  "from": {
    "ids": {"key": 1},
    "labels": ["Foo","Bar"]
  },
  "to": {
    "ids": {"otherKey":1},
    "labels": ["FooBar"]
  },
  "type":"relationship"
}
----

+
which would be transformed into the following Cypher query:

+
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [..., {
  "op": "create",
  "properties": {
    "foo": "rel-value",
    "key": 1
  },
  "rel-type": "MY-REL",
  "from": {
    "ids": {"key": 1},
    "labels": ["Foo","Bar"]
  },
  "to": {
    "ids": {"otherKey":1},
    "labels": ["FooBar"]
  },
  "type":"relationship"
}, ...] AS event
MATCH (from:Foo:Bar {key: event.from.ids.key})
MATCH (to:FooBar {otherKey: event.to.ids.otherKey})
CREATE (from)-[r:MY_REL]->(to)
SET r = event.properties
----

+
Lets describe the fields:

+
[#{id}_table_cud_rels_fields]
.CUD file **Relationship format** fields description
[cols="3",opts=header]
|===
| field
| mandatory
| Description

| op
| yes
| The operation type: create/merge/update/delete

| properties
| no
| The properties attached to the relationship

| rel_type
| yes
| The relationship type

| from
| yes, if you use the `_id` field reference into `ids` you can left labels blank
| Contains the info about the source node of the relationship.
For the description of the `ids` and `labels` fields please please look at the node fields description above

| to
| yes, if you use the `_id` field reference into `ids` you can left labels blank
| Contains the info about the target node of the relationship.
For the description of the `ids` and `labels` fields please please look at the node fields description above

| type
| yes
| The entity type: node/relationship => relationship in this case

|===

Following another example of `DELETE` operation for both node and relationship.

* For **Node**, the following JSON:

+
[source,json]
----
{
  "op": "delete",
  "properties": {},
  "ids": {"key": 1, "otherKey":  "foo"},
  "labels": ["Foo","Bar"],
  "type": "node",
  "detach": false
}
----
+
will be transformed in the following Cypher query:
+
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [..., {
  "op": "delete",
  "properties": {},
  "ids": {"key": 1, "otherKey":  "foo"},
  "labels": ["Foo","Bar"],
  "type": "node",
  "detach": false
}, ...] AS event
MATCH (n:Foo:Bar {key: event.ids.key, otherkey: event.ids.otherkey})
DELETE n
----
+
Note that if you set `"detach": true` then the transformation will be:
+
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [
...
] AS event
...
DETACH DELETE n
----

* For **Relationship**, the following JSON:

+
[source,json]
----
{
  "op": "create",
  "properties": {},
  "rel_type": "MY_REL",
  "from": {
    "ids": {"key": 1},
    "labels": ["Foo","Bar"]
  },
  "to": {
    "ids": {"otherKey":1},
    "labels": ["FooBar"]
  },
  "type":"relationship"
}
----
+
will be transformed in the following Cypher query:
+
[source,cypher]
----
UNWIND [..., {
  "op": "create",
  "properties": {},
  "rel_type": "MY_REL",
  "from": {
    "ids": {"key": 1},
    "labels": ["Foo","Bar"]
  },
  "to": {
    "ids": {"otherKey":1},
    "labels": ["FooBar"]
  },
  "type":"relationship"
}, ...] AS event
MATCH (from:Foo:Bar {key: event.from.ids.key})
MATCH (to:FooBar {otherkey: event.to.ids.otherkey})
MATCH (from)-[r:MY_REL]->(to)
DELETE r
----
