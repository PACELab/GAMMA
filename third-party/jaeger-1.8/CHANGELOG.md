1.8.1 (2018-11-23)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

1.8.0 (2018-11-12)
------------------

#### Backend Changes

##### Breaking Changes

- Refactor agent configuration ([#1092](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1092), [@pavolloffay](https://github.com/pavolloffay))

The following agent flags has has been deprecated in order to support multiple reporters:
```bash
--collector.host-port
--discovery.conn-check-timeout
--discovery.min-peers
```
New flags:
```bash
--reporter.tchannel.host-port
--reporter.tchannel.discovery.conn-check-timeout
--reporter.tchannel.discovery.min-peers
```

- Various changes around metrics produced by jaeger-query: Names scoped to the query component, generated for all span readers (not just ES), consolidate query metrics and include result tag ([#1074](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1074), [#1075](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1075) and [#1096](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/pull/1096), [@objectiser](https://github.com/objectiser))

For example, sample of metrics produced for `find_traces` operation before:

```
jaeger_find_traces_attempts 1
jaeger_find_traces_errLatency_bucket{le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_find_traces_errors 0
jaeger_find_traces_okLatency_bucket{le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_find_traces_responses_bucket{le="0.005"} 1
jaeger_find_traces_successes 1
```

And now:

```
jaeger_query_latency_bucket{operation="find_traces",result="err",le="0.005"} 0
jaeger_query_latency_bucket{operation="find_traces",result="ok",le="0.005"} 2
jaeger_query_requests{operation="find_traces",result="err"} 0
jaeger_query_requests{operation="find_traces",result="ok"} 2
jaeger_query_responses_bucket{operation="find_traces",le="0.005"} 2
```

- Update Dockerfiles to reference executable via ENTRYPOINT (#815) by Zachary DiCesare (@zdicesare)

  It is no longer necessary to specify the binary name when passing flags to containers.
  For example, to execute the `help` command of the collector, instead of
  ```
  $ docker run -it --rm jaegertracing/jaeger-collector /go/bin/collector-linux help
  ```
  run
  ```
  $ docker run -it --rm jaegertracing/jaeger-collector help
  ```

- Detect HTTP payload format from Content-Type (#916) by Yuri Shkuro (@yurishkuro)

  When submitting spans in Thrift format to HTTP endpoint `/api/traces`,
  the `format` argument is no longer required, but the Content-Type header
  must be set to "application/vnd.apache.thrift.binary".
