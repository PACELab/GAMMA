# Train Ticket：A Benchmark Microservice System

The project is a train ticket booking system based on microservice architecture which contains 41 microservices. The programming languages and frameworks it used are as below.
- Java - Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- Node.js - Express
- Python - Django
- Go - Webgo
- DB - Mongo、MySQL

You can get more details at [Wiki Pages](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket/wiki).

## Quick Start

Here is the steps to deploy the Train Ticket onto any existing Kubernetes cluster.

### 1. Presequisite

* An existing Kubernetes cluster

### 2. Deploy the application
```bash
cd deployment/quickstart-k8s-deployment/

# Deploy the databases
kubectl apply -f quickstart-ts-deployment-part1.yml
# Deploy the services
kubectl apply -f quickstart-ts-deployment-part2.yml
# Deploy the UI Dashboard
kubectl apply -f quickstart-ts-deployment-part3.yml
```

### 3. Run `kubectl get pods` to see pods are in a ready state

### 4. Visit the Train Ticket web page at [http://[Node-IP]:32677](http://[Node-IP]:32677).

**Jaeger**

we provide a Tracing System based on [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io). You can visit the Jaeger Webpage at [http://[Node-IP]:32688](http://[Node-IP]:32688) to view traces in the system.

## Build From Source

In the above, We use pre-built images to quickly deploy the application.

If you want to modify the application logic and build the application from source, you can refer to [the Installation Guide](https://github.com/FudanSELab/train-ticket/wiki/Installation-Guide).
